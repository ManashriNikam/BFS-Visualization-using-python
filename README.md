This project demonstrates Breadth-First Search (BFS) through an interactive and visual approach using Python. The goal is to help learners clearly understand how BFS explores nodes level by level in a graph or grid.

Instead of only printing traversal order, this project visually shows each step of the BFS algorithm, making it easier to grasp concepts like queue operations, visited nodes, and traversal flow.

🚀 **Features**
📌 Step-by-step visualization of BFS traversal
📊 Clear representation of visited and unvisited nodes
🔄 Uses queue-based BFS logic
🎨 Easy-to-understand visual output (console / GUI / matplotlib – based on implementation)
🧠 Beginner-friendly for learning Graph Algorithms & DSA

**Concepts Covered**
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Graph traversal
- Queue data structure
- Visited node tracking
- Time and space complexity understanding

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
- Python
- Data Structures: Queue, List, Set
- matplotlib and networkX for visualization
